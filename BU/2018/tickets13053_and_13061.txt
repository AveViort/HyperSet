Done!

BTW: the server is running Scientific Linux so the installation command
is:
yum install unixODBC-devel

apt is for debian derived systems.

Cheers,
Eric

Hej Andrej

I've set up the /etc/odbc.ini file now, and I had to change ServerName from localhost to 127.0.0.1 otherwise it was trying to use IPv6.

Try now and see if it works.
