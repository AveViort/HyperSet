Description: Spell checking common document formats including latex, markdown, manual pages,
    and description files. Includes utilities to automate checking of documentation and 
    vignettes as a unit test during 'R CMD check'. Both British and American English are 
    supported out of the box and other languages can be added. In addition, packages may
    define a 'wordlist' to allow custom terminology without having to abuse punctuation.
