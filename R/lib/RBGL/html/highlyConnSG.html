<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A graph G with n vertices is highly connected if its connectivity k(G) &gt; n/2.  The HCS algorithm partitions a given graph into a set of highly connected subgraphs, by using minimum-cut algorithm recursively.  To improve performance, the approach is refined by adopting singletons, removing low degree vertices and merging clusters.    
</p>
<p>On singleton adoption: 
after each round of partition,  some highly connected subgraphs could be
singletons (i.e., a subgraph contains only one node).
To reduce the number of singletons, therefore reduce number of clusters, 
we try to get &quot;normal&quot; subgraphs to &quot;adopt&quot; them.  If a singleton, s, has n 
neighbours in a highly connected subgraph c, and n &gt; sat, we add s to c.  
To adapt to the modified subgraphs, this adoption process is repeated until 
no further such adoption. 
</p>
<p>On lower degree vertices: when the graph has low degree vertices, minimum-cut
algorithm will just repeatedly separate these vertices from the rest. 
To reduce such expensive and non-informative computation, we &quot;remove&quot; these 
low degree vertices first before applying minimum-cut algorithm.  
Given ldv = (d1, d2, ..., dp), (d[i] &gt; d[i+1] &gt; 0), we repeat the following
(i from 1 to p): remove all the highly-connected-subgraph found so far; 
remove vertices with degrees &lt; di; find highly-connected-subgraphs; 
perform singleton adoptions. 
</p>
<p>The Boost implementation does not support self-loops, therefore we 
signal an error and suggest that users remove self-loops using the 
function <code><a href="removeSelfLoops.html">removeSelfLoops</a></code> function. This change does affect 
degree, but the original article makes no specific reference to self-loops.
