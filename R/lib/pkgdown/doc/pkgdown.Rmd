The goal of pkgdown is to make it easy for package developers to make elegant and useful packages websites. The defaults are tailored for smaller packages and for use on GitHub (particularly with new [`docs/` directory][docs] support), but it is flexible enough to be used as part of a bigger website. There are five parts to a pkgdown site:

1. Home page
1. Function reference
1. Articles
1. News
1. Navbar 

To build a pkgdown site, run `build_site()`. The function has some arguments (mostly to control where the output), but most of the configuration options are controlled by `_pkgdown.yaml`. These options include:

* The site `title`, if different from the package name.

* A path to a set of `template`, if you want to override the default
  page templates provided by the site.

* A [`bootswatch`](https://bootswatch.com) theme name to easily tweak the
  overall appearance of the site.

Other options control the appearance of the other parts of the site.

pkgdown checks for a site configuration file in these locations:

1. `_pkgdown.yml`
1. `_pkgdown.yaml`
1. `pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml`
1. `inst/_pkgdown.yml`

Including the configuration file in `inst/` enables sites to be built from packages on CRAN without needing the development version of a package.

## Home page

The home page will be automatically generated from one of the following four files:

1. `index.Rmd`
1. `README.Rmd`
1. `index.md`
1. `README.md`

pkgdown tries them in order, which means that if you want different display for GitHub and pkgdown, you can have both `README.md` and an `index.md`

When including big graphics in the README, you may find it easier to use `knitr::include_graphics("foo.png")` combined with chunk option `out.width = '100%'`. This will make the graphic scale with the size of the page.

## Reference

The function reference generates one page for each `.Rd` file in `man/`, placing the results in `reference/`. This is mostly a straightforward translation of Rd to HTML, along with evaluating the examples, and auto-linking function names to their documentation.

pkgdown will also generate an overall index, which by default, is just an alphabetically ordered list of functions. However, the index is better with human curation because functions can be grouped by function and described en masse. To override the defaults, provide a `reference` key in `_pkgdown.yml`:

```yaml
reference:
  - title: "Connecting to Spark"
    desc: >
      Functions for installing Spark components and managing
      connections to Spark
    contents: 
      - spark_config
      - spark_connect
      - spark_disconnect
      - spark_install
      - spark_log
  - title: "Reading and Writing Data"
    desc: "Functions for reading and writing Spark DataFrames."
    contents:
      - starts_with("spark_read")
      - starts_with("spark_write")
      - sdf-saveload
```

The `reference` should be an array of objects containing `title`, `desc` (description), and list of `contents`. Since common prefix and suffixes are often used for functional grouping, you can use the functions `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` to automatically include all functions with a common prefix or suffix. To match more complex patterns, use `matches()` with a regular expression.

The objects in `reference` can also contain a list of `exclude`, which allow you to exclude unwanted topics included via `contents`.

pkgdown will warn if you've forgotten to include any non-internal functions.

## Articles

pkgdown will automatically build all `.Rmd` vignettes, including those in subdirectories. The only exception are `.Rmd` vignettes that start with '_'. This enables the use of child documents in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). The output of the vignettes is rendered to `articles/`. pkgdown will ignore the output format defined in the yaml header, and always use `html_fragment(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE)`.

If you want to include an article on the website, but not in the package (e.g. because it's large), you can either place it in a subdirectory of `vignettes/` or add to `.Rbuildignore`. As well, you must ensure that there is no `vignettes:` section in the article's yaml header. In the extreme case where you want to produce only articles but not vignettes, you should add the complete `vignettes/` directory to `.Rbuildignore` and make sure that DESCRIPTION has no `VignetteBuilder` field.

As with the function reference, articles will also get a default index, and it can be customised in a similar way (referring to file names rather than function names):

```yaml
articles:
  - title: "Extend shiny"
    desc: >
      These packages provide advanced features that can enhance your Shiny 
      apps.
    contents:
    - shinydashboard
    - shinythemes
    - shinyjs
    - htmlwidgets
```

## News

If `NEWS.md` is present, it will be parsed into pieces broken up by second level headings. These will be rendered to `news/`, with one page per minor release (so that `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, and `2.2.2` are all described on a single page).

If you want more detailed release notes (aimed at teaching people about the new features), you could put these in (e.g.) `vignettes/news` and customise the navbar.

## Navbar {#navbar2}

By default, the navbar will show:

* The home page, with a "home" icon.
* "Get Started", if you have an article with the same name as the package.
* Reference
* Articles, if present.
* News, if present.
* A link to your your github repo (if listed in the `DESCRIPTION` url field).

You can override the defaults to:

* Surface important articles directly from the navbar (a la
  <http://spark.rstudio.com>).

* Provide deeper add additional hierarchical navigation (like     
  <http://www.htmlwidgets.org>).
  
* Link to other, off-site, resources.

The navbar has a similar structure to the [R Markdown website navbar][rmarkdown navbar]. To customise, use the `navbar` field:

```yaml
navbar:
  title: "sparklyr"
  type: inverse
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "dplyr"
      href: articles/dplyr.html
    - text: "ML"
      href: articles/ML.html
    - text: "Extensions"
      href: articles/extensions.html
    - text: "Deployment"
      href: articles/deployment.html
    - text: "Reference"
      href: "reference/"
  right:
    - icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr
```

## Search

pkgdown websites can integrate search capability using [Docsearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) from Algolia. Docsearch is a powerful search engine that is free for documentation websites. There are only two steps needed to enable Docsearch on a pkgdown website.

### 1. Ask Docsearch to index your site.

Once you have published your pkgdown website, submit the [pkgdown site URL to Docsearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Docsearch will contact you via e-mail to confirm you are the website owner.

Docsearch will set up a crawler configuration that indexes your site every 24 hours. pkgdown builds a suggested Docsearch crawlwer configuration in `docsearch.json` and you should point the Docsearch team to this configuration as a starting point. If you want to optimize your search, Docsearch will accept pull requests to the configuration that incorporate [additional options](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs#introduction) to fine tune the scraping.

### 2. Add Docsearch parameters to your site configuration file.

The Docsearch team will e-mail you some JavaScript to integrate into your website.

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
  docsearch({ 
    apiKey: 'API_KEY',  // a long hex string
    indexName: 'INDEX_NAME', 
    inputSelector: '### REPLACE ME ####', 
    debug: false // Set debug to true if you want to inspect the dropdown 
}); 
```

Put the value of the `apiKey` and `indexName` parameters into your site `_pkgdown.yml`:

```yaml
template:
  params:
    docsearch:
      api_key: API_KEY
      index_name: INDEX_NAME
```

If you are building your own custom Docsearch index, you can also include your Docsearch `app_id` in `_pkgdown.yml`.

Finally, you need to add a `url:` field to `_pkgdown.yml` that specifies the location of your documentation on the web. For pkgdown, the URL field is:

```yaml
url: http://pkgdown.r-lib.org
```

You should have a functional search bar after re-building your site with this new configuration. Once search is enabled on your site, pressing `shift + /` (i.e., "?") will move the focus to the search bar.
