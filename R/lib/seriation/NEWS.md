# seriation 1.2-3 (02/x05/2018)

## Bugfixes
* seriation method "BEA" is now not longer masked by "BEA_TSP". 
  Also the FORTRAN calls now work.
* SPIN: making the matrix doubly stochastic now checks 
  all rows/columns (reported and fixed by cerebis)

# seriation 1.2-2 (05/08/2017)

## New features

* Added new seriation method SA which provides simulated annealing for all 
  criterion measures.
* Added criterion Cor_R (ME for the moment ordering algorithm by 
  Deutsch and Martin).
* Added uniscale to produce a unidimensional scaling configuration given
  a distance matrix and a permutation.
* Criterion gained parameter force_loss (default is FALSE). Merit measures 
  are converted into loss values by multiplying with -1.
* Added Supreme Court dataset.

## Changes and bugfixes

* Default for seriate (dist) and dissplot is now "Spectal" since it 
  gives a better tradeoff between quality and speed.
* Seriaiton method ARSA's control argument nreps is now for consistency 
  called reps.
* Criterion: dist objects are now automatically converted into a
  similarity matrix for ME, Moore\_stress and Neumann\_stress.
* pimage now suppresses the color key for logical matrices and checks for
  all NAs and infinite entries.
* Correction: ARSA minimizes the linear seriation criterion (man 
  page and vignette). 

# seriation 1.2-1 (08/06/2016)

## New features

* Added new distance measure called absolute pairwise rank differences.

## Changes and bugfixes

* The default setting for ser_dist and ser_cor is now reverse is TRUE.
* pimage does now work with matrices containing only a single value.
* control parameters for method TSP are now correctly passed on
  (reported by David Aliyev).

* hmap now honors zlim also in dendrogram-based maps.
* hmap gained option sym for seriation based maps. showdist can now be
      one of "none" (default), "row", "column", or "both".
* ser_cor and ser_dist gained parameter y. ser_cor gained parameter test
      to perform tests for association.
* Added permute method for hclust and dendrogram objects.

# seriation 1.1-2 (8/23/2015)

* Argument (control and ...) check warns now instead of throwing an error.
* seriation_dist, seriation_cor and seriation_align are now shortened to
      ser_dist, ser_cor and ser_align.
* Method "ppc" is now faster and also available in ser_cor.
* Fixed ser_cor for "spearman" and "Kendall" (uses now rank correctly).
* ser_cor and ser_dist gained parameter reverse to indicate that
        permuations are also tried in reverse and the best value is reported.

* get_permutation_matrix added.
* seriation_dist measure "ppc" (positional proximity coefficient) added.
