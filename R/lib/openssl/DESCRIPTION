Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH pubkey parsers.
    Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and P-521. Cryptographic signatures
    can either be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be
    used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public
    key) encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine
    RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key
    generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure
    random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing
    crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.
