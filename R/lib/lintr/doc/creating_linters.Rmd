This vignette describes the steps necessary to create a new linter.

A good example of a simple linter is the `assignment_linter`.
```r
#' @describeIn linters checks that '<-' is always used for assignment
#' @export
assignment_linter <- function(source_file) {
  lapply(ids_with_token(source_file, "EQ_ASSIGN"),
    function(id) {
      parsed <- source_file$parsed_content[id, ]
      Lint(
        filename = source_file$filename,
        line_number = parsed$line1,
        column_number = parsed$col1,
        type = "style",
        message = "Use <-, not =, for assignment.",
        line = source_file$lines[parsed$line1]
        )
    })
}
```

Lets walk through the parts of the linter individually.

## Writing the linter ##
The first two lines add the linter to the `linters` documentation and export it
for use outside the package.

```r
#' @describeIn linters checks that '<-' is always used for assignment
#' @export
```

Next we define the name of the new linter.  The convention is that all linter
names are suffixed by `_linter`.
```r
assignment_linter <- function(source_file) {
```

Your linter will be called by each top level expression in the file to be
linted.

The raw text of the expression is available from `source_file$content`. However it is
recommended to work with the tokens from
`source_file$parsed_content` if possible, as they are tokenzied from the `R`
parser. These tokens are obtained from `parse()` and `getParseData()`
calls done prior to calling the new linter. `getParseData()` returns a `data.frame`
with information from the source parse tree of the file being linted. A list of
tokens available from
[r-source/src/main/gram.y](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/ff1bca2f21aba271d428474f00494eece5c36dd3/src/main/gram.y#L293-L307).

`ids_with_token()` can be used to search for a specific token and return the
associated id.  Note that the `rownames` for `parsed_content` are set to the
`id`, so you can retrieve the rows for a given id with
`source_file$parsed_content[id, ]`.

```r
lapply(ids_with_token(source_file, "EQ_ASSIGN"),
  function(id) {
    parsed <- source_file$parsed_content[id, ]
```

Lastly build a `Lint` object which describes the issue.  See `?Lint` for a
description of the arguments.

```r
Lint(
  filename = source_file$filename,
  line_number = parsed$line1,
  column_number = parsed$col1,
  type = "style",
  message = "Use <-, not =, for assignment.",
  line = source_file$lines[parsed$line1]
  )
```

You do not have to return a Lint for every iteration of your loop.  Feel free
to return `NULL` or empty lists() for tokens which do not need to be linted.
You can even return a `list` of `Lint` objects if more than one Lint was found.

## Writing linter tests ##
The `linter` package uses [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) for
testing. You can run all of the currently available tests using
`devtools::test()`.  If you want to run only the tests in a given file use the
`filter` argument to `devtools::test()`.

Linter tests should be put in the
[tests/testthat/](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/tree/master/tests/testthat)
folder.  The test filename should be the linter name prefixed by `test-`, e.g.
`test-assignment_linter.R`.

The first line in the test file should be a line which defines the context of the text (the linter name).
```r
context("assignment_linter")
```

You can then specify one or more `test_that` functions.  Most of the linters use the same default form.
```r
test_that("returns the correct linting", {
```

You then test a series of expectations for the linter using `expect_lint`.
Please see `?expect_lint` for a full description of the parameters.

I try to test 3 main things.

1. Linter returns no lints when there is nothing to lint. e.g.

```r
expect_lint("blah", NULL, assignment_linter)
```

2. Linter returns a lint when there is something to lint. e.g.

```r
expect_lint("blah=1",
  rex("Use <-, not =, for assignment."),
    assignment_linter)
```

3. As many edge cases as you can think of that might break it. e.g.

```r
expect_lint("fun((blah = fun(1)))",
  rex("Use <-, not =, for assignment."),
  assignment_linter)
```

It is always better to write too many tests rather than too few.

## Adding your linter to the default_linters ##
If your linter is non-project specific you can add it to `default_linters`.
This object is created in the file `zzz.R`.  The name ensures that it will always run after all
the linters are defined.  Simply add your linter name to the `default_linters`
list before the `NULL` at the end.

## Submit pull request ##
Push your changes to a branch of your fork of the
[lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) repository, and submit a pull
request to get your linter merged into lintr!
