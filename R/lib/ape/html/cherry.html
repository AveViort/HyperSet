<h2>Number of Cherries and Null Models of Trees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the number of cherries (see definition below)
on a phylogenetic tree, and tests the null hypotheses whether this
number agrees with those predicted from two null models of trees (the
Yule model, and the uniform model).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
cherry(phy)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>phy</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>"phylo"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A cherry is a pair of adjacent tips on a tree. The tree can be either
rooted or unrooted, but the present function considers only rooted
trees. The probability distribution function of the number of cherries
on a tree depends on the speciation/extinction model that generated
the tree.
</p>
<p>McKenzie and Steel (2000) derived the probability
distribution function of the number of cherries for two models: the
Yule model and the uniform model. Broadly, in the Yule model, each extant
species is equally likely to split into two daughter-species; in the
uniform model, a branch is added to tree on any of the already
existing branches with a uniform probability.
</p>
<p>The probabilities are computed using recursive formulae; however, for
both models, the probability density function converges to a normal
law with increasing number of tips in the tree. The function uses
these normal approximations for a number of tips greater than or equal
to 20.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A NULL value is returned, the results are simply printed.
