<h2>Fits a Bunch of Models with PhyML</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calls PhyML and fits successively 28 models of DNA
evolution. The results are saved on disk, as PhyML usually does, and
returned in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> as a vector with the log-likelihood value of each model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
phymltest(seqfile, format = "interleaved", itree = NULL,
          exclude = NULL, execname = NULL, append = TRUE)
## S3 method for class 'phymltest'
print(x, ...)
## S3 method for class 'phymltest'
summary(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'phymltest'
plot(x, main = NULL, col = "blue", ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seqfile</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the name of the file that
contains the DNA sequences to be analysed by PhyML.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the format of the DNA
sequences: either <code>"interleaved"</code> (the default), or
<code>"sequential"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>itree</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the name of a file with a tree
in Newick format to be used as an initial tree by PhyML. If
<code>NULL</code> (the default), PhyML uses a &ldquo;BIONJ&rdquo; tree.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of mode character giving the models to be
excluded from the analysis. These must be among those below, and
follow the same syntax.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>execname</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the name of the PhyML
executable. This argument can be left as <code>NULL</code> if PhyML's
default names are used: <code>"phyml_3.0_linux32"</code>,
<code>"phyml_3.0_macintel"</code>, or <code>"phyml_3.0_win32.exe"</code>, under
Linux, MacOS, or Windows respectively.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>append</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating whether to erase previous PhyML
output files if present; the default is to not erase.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>"phymltest"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>"phymltest"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
<p>a title for the plot; if left <code>NULL</code>, a title is made
with the name of the object (use <code>main = ""</code> to have no
title).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>col</code></td>
<td>
<p>a colour used for the segments showing the AIC values (blue
by default).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments passed to or from other methods.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The present function requires version 3.0.1 of PhyML; it won't work with
older versions.
</p>
<p>The user must take care to set correctly the three different paths
involved here: the path to PhyML's binary, the path to the sequence
file, and the path to R's working directory. The function should work
if all three paths are different. Obviously, there should be no problem
if they are all the same.
</p>
<p>The following syntax is used for the models:
</p>
<p>&quot;X[Y][Z]00[+I][+G]&quot;
</p>
<p>where &quot;X&quot; is the first letter of the author of the model, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;
are possibly other co-authors of the model, &quot;00&quot; is the year of the
publication of the model, and &quot;+I&quot; and &quot;+G&quot; indicates whether the
presence of invariant sites and/or a gamma distribution of
substitution rates have been specified. Thus, Kimura's model is
denoted &quot;K80&quot; and not &quot;K2P&quot;. The exception to this rule is the general
time-reversible model which is simple denoted &quot;GTR&quot; model.
</p>
<p>The seven substitution models used are: &quot;JC69&quot;, &quot;K80&quot;, &quot;F81&quot;, &quot;F84&quot;,
&quot;HKY85&quot;, &quot;TN93&quot;, and &quot;GTR&quot;. These models are then altered by adding
the &quot;+I&quot; and/or &quot;+G&quot;, resulting thus in four variants for each of them
(e.g., &quot;JC69&quot;, &quot;JC69+I&quot;, &quot;JC69+G&quot;, &quot;JC69+I+G&quot;). Some of these models
are described in the help page of <code><a href="dist.dna.html">dist.dna</a></code>.
</p>
<p>When a gamma distribution of substitution rates is specified, four
categories are used (which is PhyML's default behaviour), and the
&ldquo;alpha&rdquo; parameter is estimated from the data.
</p>
<p>For the models with a different substition rate for transitions and
transversions, these rates are left free and estimated from the data
(and not constrained with a ratio of 4 as in PhyML's default).
</p>
<p>The option <code>path2exec</code> has been removed in the present version:
the path to PhyML's executable can be specified with the option
<code>execname</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>phymltest</code> returns an object of class <code>"phymltest"</code>: a
numeric vector with the models as names.
</p>
<p>The <code>print</code> method prints an object of class <code>"phymltest"</code>
as matrix with the name of the models, the number of free parameters,
the log-likelihood value, and the value of the Akaike information
criterion (AIC = -2 * loglik + 2 * number of free parameters)
</p>
<p>The <code>summary</code> method prints all the possible likelihood ratio
tests for an object of class <code>"phymltest"</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>plot</code> method plots the values of AIC of an object of class
<code>"phymltest"</code> on a vertical scale.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the models fitted by this function is
only a small fraction of the models possible with PhyML. For instance,
it is possible to vary the number of categories in the (discretized)
gamma distribution of substitution rates, and many parameters can be
fixed by the user. The results from the present function should rather
be taken as indicative of a best model.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
### A `fake' example with random likelihood values: it does not
### make sense, but does not need PhyML and gives you a flavour
### of what the output looks like:
x &lt;- runif(28, -100, -50)
names(x) &lt;- ape:::.phymltest.model
class(x) &lt;- "phymltest"
x
summary(x)
plot(x)
plot(x, main = "", col = "red")
### This example needs PhyML, copy/paste or type the
### following commands if you want to try them, eventually
### changing setwd() and the options of phymltest()
## Not run: 
setwd("D:/phyml_v2.4/exe") # under Windows
data(woodmouse)
write.dna(woodmouse, "woodmouse.txt")
X &lt;- phymltest("woodmouse.txt")
X
summary(X)
plot(X)

## End(Not run)
