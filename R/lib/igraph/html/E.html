<h2>Edges of a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An edge sequence is a vector containing numeric edge ids, with a special
class attribute that allows custom operations: selecting subsets of
edges based on attributes, or graph structure, creating the
intersection, union of edges, etc.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
E(graph, P = NULL, path = NULL, directed = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of vertices to select edges via pairs of vertices.
The first and second vertices select the first edge, the third
and fourth the second, etc.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of vertices, to select edges along a path.
Note that this only works reliable for simple graphs. If the graph
has multiple edges, one of them will be chosen arbitrarily to
be included in the edge sequence.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to consider edge directions in the <code>P</code>
argument, for directed graphs.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Edge sequences are usually used as igraph function arguments that 
refer to edges of a graph.
</p>
<p>An edge sequence is tied to the graph it refers to: it really denoted
the specific edges of that graph, and cannot be used together with
another graph.
</p>
<p>An edge sequence is most often created by the <code>E()</code> function. The
result includes edges in increasing edge id order by default (if. none
of the <code>P</code> and <code>path</code> arguments are used). An edge
sequence can be indexed by a numeric vector, just like a regular R
vector. See links to other edge sequence operations below.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An edge sequence of the graph.
</p>


<h3>Indexing edge sequences</h3>

<p>Edge sequences mostly behave like regular vectors, but there are some
additional indexing operations that are specific for them;
e.g. selecting edges based on graph structure, or based on edge
attributes. See <code><a href="igraph-es-indexing.html">[.igraph.es</a></code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Querying or setting attributes</h3>

<p>Edge sequences can be used to query or set attributes for the
edges in the sequence. See <code><a href="igraph-es-attributes.html">$.igraph.es</a></code> for details.
</p>

# Edges of an unnamed graph
