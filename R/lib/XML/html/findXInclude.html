<h2>Find the XInclude node associated with an XML node</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to traverse the ancestors of an 
internal XML node to find the associated XInclude 
node that identifies it as being an XInclude'd node.
Each top-level node that results from an include href=... in the libxml2 parser
is sandwiched between nodes of class
XMLXIncludeStartNode and XMLXIncludeStartNode.
These are the sibling nodes.
</p>
<p>Another approach to finding the origin of the XInclude for a given
node is to search for an attribute xml:base. This only works if the
document being XInclude'd is in a different directory than the base document.
If this is the case, we can use an XPath query to find the node
containing the attribute via <code>"./ancestor::*[@xml:base]"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
findXInclude(x, asNode = FALSE, recursive = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the node whose XInclude &quot;ancestor&quot; is to be found</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>asNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether to return the node itself or
the attributes of the node which are typically the immediately interesting 
aspect of the node.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>recursive</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value that controls whether the 
full path of the nested includes is returned or just the
path in the immediate XInclude element.</p>
</td></tr>  
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Either <code>NULL</code> if there was no node of class XMLXIncludeStartNode
found.
Otherwise, if <code>asNode</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, that  XMLXIncludeStartNode
node is returned, or alternatively its attribute character vector.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

 f = system.file("exampleData", "functionTemplate.xml", package = "XML")

 cat(readLines(f), "\n")

 doc = xmlParse(f)

  # Get all the para nodes
  # We just want to look at the 2nd and 3rd which are repeats of the
  # first one.
 a = getNodeSet(doc, "//author")
 findXInclude(a[[1]])

 i = findXInclude(a[[1]], TRUE)
 top = getSibling(i)

   # Determine the top-level included nodes
 tmp = getSibling(i)
 nodes = list()
 while(!inherits(tmp, "XMLXIncludeEndNode")) {
   nodes = c(nodes, tmp)
   tmp = getSibling(tmp)
