Description: Interactive plotting functions for use within RStudio.
  The manipulate function accepts a plotting expression and a set of
  controls (e.g. slider, picker, checkbox, or button) which are used
  to dynamically change values within the expression. When a value is
  changed using its corresponding control the expression is
  automatically re-executed and the plot is redrawn.
