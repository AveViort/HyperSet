<p class="headr1">How to use stand-alone R software for NEA</p>
The same procedures that run at the web site can be more systematically implemented using the package 
<span class="hlight">NEArender</span>. It contains basic functions for network and gene set enrichment analyses, creating, re-formatting, and saving gene set lists, as well as benchmarking the networks.

<span id="heading1" class="headr2">Installation of NEArender package  </span>
<br></br>
<span class="hlight">NEArender</span> can be installed from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NEArender/index.html">R CRAN </a> directly within R environment. The only recommendation is to install first the required package <span class="hlight">ROCR</span> (it might be sensitive to some other dependencies).

<span id="heading2" class="headr2"> Create Altered Gene Sets (AGS) input file </span>
<br></br>
We first could create a set of AGS that distinguish each cell line sample in the collection from 
the others.

<span id="heading3" class="headr2">Importing Functional Gene Sets (FGS) and Networks</span>
<br></br>
Plotting  the gene frequency distribution demonstrates that the most of the genes are quite 
unique (below). Next, we run the network enrichment analysis, analyzing enrichment of each 
of these cell-line specific AGSs against each of the 330 pathways in the FGS collection

 We now are in the position to identify pathway -level correlates  of drug sensitivity, such as these two pathways  associated with resistance to  <span class="hlight"> lapatinib </span>. Furthermore, this correlation can be traced between two independent drug screens  <span class="hlight"> (Barretina et al., 2012 and Garnett et al., 2012) </span>. While using original gene expression values, such correlation would be much weaker

The two pathways seems to have discovered a global trend: correlation coefficients  from the two drug screens correlate with each other, too
