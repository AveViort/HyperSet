<p class="headr1"><span>User
roles</span></p>

<p><span>Users are divided into the following
categories:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Registered (registration requires email address as a login name and a password), with
     following subcategories relatively to project:</span></li>
 <ol start=1 type=a>
  <li><span>Administrators,
      can upload files and make changes to projects, add and remove project
      members, remove projects, share projects with unregistered users.</span></li>
  <li><span>Read/write
      - can upload and delete files, run analysis;</span></li>
  <li><span>Read-only - can only run analysis and view results.</span></li>
 </ol>
 <li><span>Unregistered ("Anonymous") user, have Read/write roles in public projects.</span></li>
</ol>


<p class="headr1"><span>Project types</span></p>

<p><span>All users can create projects. User who
created a project automatically becomes an Administrator in this project.
Projects can be divided into the following groups:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Private
     - all projects (by default) created by registered users. Project
     Administrator can add or remove project members.</span></li>
 <li><span>Public
     - all projects created by Anonymous user (by default) or projects which
     were made public by their Administrators. In the first case Anonymous user
     has Administrator role, but cannot really use it (for only registered
     users have "Settings" panel): he cannot remove project or make it private.
     In the second case, Anonymous user has Read-only role, but project
     Administrator can make project private anytime, or even remove it.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><b><span lang=EN style='color:red'>All project names (Project IDs) should be unique!</span><span
lang=EN> </span></b><span>Project IDs can contain only upper and lower
letters of Latin alphabet and digits.</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Project
Administrators special warning</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Project Administrators can change roles of the
project users anytime. However, Administrators cannot do the following:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Delete
     another Administrator from project.</span></li>
 <li><span>Change
     role of another Administrator.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>All these manipulations can be done only by EviNet webmaster. Project Administrator should write a
message to EviNet webmaster if one wants to perform
any forbidden operations listed above.</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>How to manage your projects</span></p>

<p><span>First, log in into EviNet.
If you are not registered yet - sign up. Please use valid mail for
registration. Then choose <b><i>Project settings</i></b> button.</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p43.gif">
<p><span>In the opened form you can see your projects and their options.</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p45.gif">

<p><span>This page contains 3 tables:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Projects
     you are currently member of.</span></li>
 <li><span>Projects
     you were invited to join.</span></li>
 <li><span>Invitations you have sent.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>We are going to discuss these tabs in details.
Please note that some elements are only visible to Administrator.</span></p>

<p><span>First, projects table. From left to right:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Project
     ID - these IDs are used for project access.</span></li>
 <li><span>Your access level - this column shows your role in each project. Point to the
     icon to get description.</span></li>
 <li><span>Accept notifications - if you want to receive notifications from the project,
     this option should be checked (opened envelope). This setting is important
     for Administrators.</span></li>
 <li><span>Project status - project can be private (locked icon) or public (unlocked icon).
     Press the locked icon to make the project public. Visible only to
     Administrator.</span></li>
 <li><span>Project members - this column contains select menus with members for each project
     where you has an Administrator role. See "Listing project members" for
     additional information.</span></li>
 <li><span>Delete member - press this button to remove the chosen member from the respective
     project (also see "Project Administrators special warnings").</span></li>
 <li><span>Add member - press this button to open fields for adding a new member to your
     project (see "Adding project members" and "Changing user role").</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>Second, received invitations table, from left to right:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Project ID - ID of the project you have been invited to join.</span></li>
 <li><span>Sent by - username (mail) of Administrator who has invited you.</span></li>
 <li><span>Invitation date.</span></li>
 <li><span>Your access level - your proposed role in the project.</span></li>
 <li><b><i><span>Accept</span></i></b><span> and <b><i>Reject</i></b> buttons -
     these buttons allow to accept or reject invitation. <b>Warning</b>: this cannot be undone.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>Finally, sent invitations, from left to right:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Project ID - ID of the project you have invited a new member to.</span></li>
 <li><span>Member - username (mail) of the invited member.</span></li>
 <li><span>Invitation date.</span></li>
 <li><span>Access level - role you have offered to the invited member.</span></li>
 <li><b><i><span>Cancel invitation button</span></i></b><span> - click this
     button to cancel invitation.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>See "Invitations" to learn more about
invitations.</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Listing project members</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If you have an Administrator role in project,
you can view and manage project members. To do this, just click on the selector
in "Project settings" window.</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p47.gif">

<p><span>You can see member's username (email address) and role in the respective project.</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Invitations</span></p>

<p><span>Members cannot be added to the project directly. Instead, we use mechanisms of invitations, so each user can decide if
to join a project or not. The following rules and restrictions regulates the procedure of adding a new member to the project:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Only Administrators can send invitations.</span></li>
 <li><span>Invitations can be sent to registered users with activated accounts only.</span></li>
 <li><span>Only one invitation to a specific project can exist for a user. This means the following:</span></li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=a>
  <li><span>Several invitations cannot be sent by Administrator. </span></li>
  <li><span>Several invitations cannot be sent to a user by different Administrators. Only
      the first invitation will be sent. Administrators cannot view invitations
      of each other, but can get notifications about invitations via mail.</span></li>
 </ol>
 <li><span>Invitation cannot be changed. If you need to change it - cancel it and send a new one.</span></li>
</ol>


<p class="headr1"><span>Inviting project members</span></p>

<p><span>To invite a new member to your project, just click <b><i>Add member</i></b> button in the "Project settings" window for the respective
project (you have to be an Administrator).</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p49.gif">

<p><span>Type email of the registered EviNet user into the appeared input field, choose the
desired role using selector to the right of the input field and click <b><i>Add</i></b>
button (curved arrow next to role selector). In the case of success pop-up
window with success message will appear and you will see invitation in sent
invitations tab.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><span> user has to be registered before joining the project. If the person
does not have EviNet account - ask one to register.
See also "Project Administrators special warning".</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Accept or reject an invitation</span></p>

<p><span>Received notifications tab has 3 icons after
the date field: the first one indicates your role in the project (point to this
pictogram to get the text description), the remaining ones are <b><i>Accept</i></b>
(heart) and <b><i>Reject</i></b> (crossed circle) buttons respectively.</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p51.gif">

<p><span>To accept or reject an invitation simply click
the respective buttons in received invitations table. The invitation will
immediately disappear from received invitations table and (if the invitation
has been accepted) a new record for the project will appear in your projects
table.</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Cancel an invitation</span></p>

<p><span>Invitation can be cancelled anytime before user accepts/rejects it. To cancel an
invitation simply click <b><i>Cancel invitation</i></b> button for the respective project.</span></p>

<img src="../pics/help_pics/p53.gif">

<p><span>Invitation will disappear from your sent
invitations table and member's received invitations table. Warning: if you
cancel an invitation when member you sent invitation to already has opened
"Project settings" window, member will still be able to press <b><i>Accept</i></b>
or <b><i>Reject</i></b>, but the result of this operation will be failure because invitation does not
exist anymore.</span></p>

<p><span>If you sent invitation by mistake and member
has accepted it - you can delete him from the project (see "Removing member
from a project") if he is not an Administrator. If he has an Administrator role
- see "Project Administrators special warning".</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Changing user role</span></p>

<p><span>You can change user role by simply adding him
again to the project (without removing). For example, you have user <a
href="mailto:user@example.com"><span style='color:#1155CC'>user@example.com</span></a>
with access level "Read-only". You can change user role to "Read/write" by
clicking <b><i>Add member</i></b> button, typing <a href="mailto:user@example.com"><span
style='color:#1155CC'>user@example.com</span></a> into the input field,
choosing "Read/write" with the selector and clicking <b><i>Add</i></b> button. You can give
user the same rights user already had. You can find matrix of transitions
between different roles below. Columns list current roles and rows list desired
roles, if transition can be made - there will be "+" sign in the respective
cell (or "-" sign in the opposite case).</span></p>

Confirm your choice. See also "Project Administrators special warning".</span></p>


<p class="headr1"><span>Public projects</span></p>

<p><span>Projects, created by Anonymous user, are
always public, which means everyone can access them using Project ID. However,
such projects (created by Anonymous) will not be displayed in Project table of
registered users.</span></p>

<p><span>Registered users can make their projects
public. Such public projects are different from public projects, created by
Anonymous:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li><span>Project members can see such projects in their "Project settings".</span></li>
 <li><span>Such projects may become private again.</span></li>
</ol>

will be created with enabled notifications. <b>Warning:</b> changing this setting will also affect all the current
projects! You have to restore settings for specific projects. </span></p>

<p><span>You can also change your password here. If you do not remember your password, you have to log out and use "Forgot password"
option (or do it from another device). <b>Warning:</b> all your sessions (except for the one in which you have changed your password)
will be closed due to security reasons.</span></p>
