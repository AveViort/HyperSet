				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the web server functionality?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
						Server Druggable was created to provide the biomedical research community with a handy tool for quick look-up at data from large public repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) as well as mining basic functional relations via statistical and network tools. Many resources have enabled such access (OncoMine, PharmacoDB, CTD etc.) but none of them, to the best of our knowledge, combined quick data access, advanced visualization, and basic correlation analysis between 2 or 3 variables, including phenotype information. 
						Partially, the issue was addressed by project-specific sites, but then there was no way to cross-check findings in alternative in vitro screens and cohorts. The idea of our server came from collaboration experience. Oftentimes biologists - often possessing just basic Excel skills - are left alone with the task to download, parse, and organize the big datasets in order to perform relatively simple visual and statistical analyses. Many did not manage the difficulties and resorted to own lab experiments just to establish a correlation which could have been readily recovered from a public resource. 
						For the same reason, molecular “biomarkers” too often get published without proper biological and statistical validation. Therefore, the new web server provides access to sub-network views of the pathway correlates, which uses the engine of our server Evinet.org, also published in NAR (Jeggari et a., 2018) but not directly related to that. Druggable provides both pre-calculated lists of correlates and direct access to the datasets.

					<p>The data integration using global gene networks has the following strengths: 
						<ul>
							<li>The global network includes all major types of molecular interactions, hence the analysis readily incorporates data from different platforms.</li> 
							<li>The problem of cancer heterogeneity at the levels of individual promoters, genes, and proteins is solved by summarizing them to pathways via e.g. the Network Enrichment Analysis, and </li>
							<li>The pathway view enables efficient, low-dimensional statistical analysis and is transparent for biological interpretation. </li>

					<p>Our work demonstrated advantage of network enrichment analysis (NEA) scores over single gene/protein profiles. The same was true in a comparison against enrichment scores produced by other methods. This was proved in terms of robustness and reproducibility in independent datasets and cohorts:</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> 
						The table in second tab allows extracting lists of molecular correlates from particular omics platforms for specific drugs. In CCLE, we calculated correlates of drug sensitivity <i>in vitro</i> in the commonly accepted 2-factorial linear model, where the tissue of origin served a covariate. Therefore, the other model term, called "feature" represents a "net" effect of the molecular feature. <br>
						In TCGA, the 2-factorial models with interaction terms allowed comparison of disease outcome given high vs. low molecular feature score between groups of patients who differed in having/not having the drug treatment in the clinical history. Thus the significant (i.e. low p-value) "interaction" term in the model points to a predictive potential of the molecular feature with regard of the treatment outcome.

					<p> 
						The thrid tab provides access to most of the big datasets in TCGA  and CCLE. Users can choose plotting selected variables, such as gene expression or mutation profiles, against each other or versus clinical or cytological variables. 
						By clicking at '+' in the end of each line, one can add up to 3 dimensions to the plot (the 3rd one would then be represented as color or shape). Variable scales can be adjusted via log or square root transformation. If a certain data-plot combination is not enabled, it is recommended to remove the lines and start again in a different order.

						Most plots on the site are created with <a href=https://plot.ly/>plotly</a> library, which means they are highly interactive. If you have several datalines on scatter plot - you can turn some of them of (same goes for pie charts). On scatter plots which contain netowrk enrichment analysis data you can click on points to see the subnetwrok connecting patient's altered genes and chosen pathway.
						<br>
						You can use these plots on your own website or for publication. You can either download plotly plot as png (by clicking the respective button on the plot modebar in upper-right corner) or (all plots) get URL. To get URL simply click on "Get link" button under the plot. You can either use this link to view plot as a separate page or embed it into your page.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#8">Building predictive models</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
						This site allows you to build multidimensional predictive models. For this, you need to go to the respective tab, then choose what you want to predict (dependent variable). For TCGA data you can choose which samples will be used for dependent and independent variables (e.g. only samples from primary solid tumor, see code explanation <a href=https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/sample-type-codes target="_blank">here</a>), for CCLE you can choose cell lines by choosing their tissue of origin. If you will choose just one variable - you will get a 2D plot instead of multidimensional model.
						You can choose if you want model verification or not. After your model is built, you can explore it, download it (using the respective button), view coefficients. Table with coefficients contains their weights and "Plot" button for each of them. Click this button if you want to plot data behind this coefficient (it will use response variable data for another axis).
